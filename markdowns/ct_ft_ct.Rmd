So far we have been dealing with continuous variables - where the values well are continuous and not discrete. So counts would be a discrete value, for example having 10 patients. Gene expression is an example of a continuous variable as you can have values in between, say like having a value of 10, 10.3, 10.5, 11, 11.1, etc.. So what if we want to compare two groups of categorical variables? The contingency table can help us here! A contingency table shows us the frequency distribution between variables ([Wikipedia][1]). Let's try it out with our glioma data!

```{r contingency, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load("./lgg.rda")

#let's look at gender versus history of prior malignancy
table(
  lgg$PatientData$gender,
  lgg$PatientData$prior_malignancy
  )
```

So here we see that out of all the female patients 233 did not have a history of prior malignancy and 8 did. Conversely, 286 male patients did not have a history of prior malignancy and 6 did. Now looking at this we can see that there really isn't a big difference between these categorical variables. But what if we wanted a p-value out of this table? Enter the Chi-square test! But how does it work? Well for that we need to look at the Chi-square test statistic:

![chi_test](images/chi_test.PNG)

* Where O is the observed value and E is the expected value
* degrees of freedom = (number of rows - 1)(number of columns - 1)

Let's apply this in R:

```{r chi,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load("./lgg.rda")

#now let's use the chi-square test!
chisq.test(
table(
  lgg$PatientData$gender,
  lgg$PatientData$prior_malignancy
  )
)

#what about getting the expected values?
chisq.test(
table(
  lgg$PatientData$gender,
  lgg$PatientData$prior_malignancy
  )
)$expected

```

So, as we expected the p-value tells us there isn't a significant difference between these categorical variables. But, the chi-square test is really suited to small sample sizes. For that we need the Fisher Exact test. What is special about the Fisher Exact test is that it is non-parametric, meaning it makes no assumption about the underlying distribution ([Wikipedia][2]). Which is good for small sample sizes given that the underlying distribution is better approximated by larger sample sizes. Let's take a peak under the hood.

Using our example with gender v. primary diagnosis:

![ct](images/ct.PNG)

![fisher_p](images/fisher_p.PNG)

While it would be fun to calculate these factorials, we can leverage the ```fisher.test()``` function in R:

```{r fisher, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load("./lgg.rda")

#now let's use the fisher test!
fisher.test(
table(
  lgg$PatientData$gender,
  lgg$PatientData$prior_malignancy
  )
)

```
