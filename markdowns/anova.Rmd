So what IS an ANOVA? Well an ANOVA is essentially just a statistical test of whether or not two or more groups have the same mean ([Wikipedia][1]). When you are comparing two groups using an ANOVA, the results are actually the same. Let's illustrate that!

```{r ttest.anova, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load("./lgg.rda")

#let's see if the ANOVA and t-test can come up with the same result
#when comparing sex v. IDH1 expression

library(limma)
log.trans <- log2(lgg$ExpressionData + 1)
norm.data <- normalizeQuantiles(log.trans)

#grab sex and IDH1 expression data
sex <- lgg$PatientData$gender
idh1 <- as.numeric(
  norm.data[grepl("IDH1",rownames(norm.data)),]
)
                    
#let's use the t-test:
t.test(idh1~as.factor(sex),var.equal=TRUE)

#and now the anova
anova(lm(idh1~as.factor(sex)))

```

Woah, cool right! Before we dig deeper, we should explore the logic behind the ANOVA. Let's start with the sum of squares, or the sum of the deviations from a mean. So if you have a list of numbers ```4,5,4,3,6```, the mean would be ```4.4```. The sum of squares would just be adding the square of how far away each number in the list is from the mean:

Formula:

![sum_of_squares](images/sum_of_squares.PNG)

** Xi = value at i, X = mean 

Worked Example:

```
sum of squares = (4-4.4)^2 + (5-4.4)^2 + (4-4.4)^2 + (3-4.4)^2 + (6-4.4)^2 = 5.2
```

Now we **variance** is this sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom ```n - 1```:

![variance](images/variance.PNG)

Worked Example:

```
variance = 5.2/(n-1) = 5.2/(5-1) = 5.2/4 = 1.3
```
or in R:

```{r var, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
var(c(4,5,4,3,6))
```

Now an ANOVA uses the variance within groups (so how far away each value is to the group mean - a.k.a MSS within) and the variance between groups (how far each group's mean is from the overall mean - a.k.a MSS between). Now we are in a position to get the F-statistic we say in the ANOVA results above:

![f_statistic](images/f_statistic.PNG)

So let's do this the easy way with the ```anova()``` function and test multiple groups this time:

```{r lgg.lm.anova,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#so let's use ANOVA to analyze IDH1 expression across different primary diagnoses:

#normalize and filter
library(limma)
log.trans <- log2(lgg$ExpressionData + 1)
norm.data <- normalizeQuantiles(log.trans)
diagnosis <- lgg$PatientData$primary_diagnosis

#grab IDH1 expression and diagnoses
idh1 <- as.numeric(
  norm.data[grepl("IDH1",rownames(norm.data)),]
)
df <- data.frame(
  diagnosis = diagnosis,
  idh1 = idh1
)

#implement the ANOVA:
anova(lm(idh1~as.factor(diagnosis),data = df))
```
## Assumptions/Limitations

Now might be a good time to talk about some assumptions/limitations. So above we saw that there is a significant difference between groups. **BUT** we don't see which group is significantly different. We could calculate means for each group or we could visualize the distributions:

```{r vis, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=diagnosis, y=idh1,fill=diagnosis)) + 
  geom_violin()+
  coord_flip()
```

So here we can see that anaplastic astrocytomas have a slightly higher mean than the other groups. 

It is also important that here we are using the ANOVA on a linear model and as such we need to consider the assumptions of a linear model ([Wikipedia][1]):

- independence of the observations
- normality of the residuals (can be tested with the Shapiro Test)
- Variances in each group should be the same (homoscedasticity)

That last point is important, because as you may have noted above, the t-test results and the ANOVA results are only the same when the variances are assumed to be equal. Despite these limitations, the ANOVA is still a powerful tool in assessing differences between groups.
