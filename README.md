# Bioinformatica

Welcome to the working repository for Bioinformatica! Here I will apply various bioinformatics analysis techniques to TCGA-LLG data in an effort to both cement my understanding of these topics but also provide a resource for others learning bioinformatics. Topics will include: regression, ANOVA, model building, PCA, clustering, machine learning, network analysis, etc.

## How Do I See Your Pages BioNomad?

Glad you asked! So the *ultimate* goal is to turn all the GitHub documents into a GitHub Page. But I'd like to have all the topic notes ready before then. In the meantime, you can view the topic notes I've created by going into "pages_you_can_read", then into one of the folders and click on one of the ".md" files. These are the prepared topic notes. Happy reading!
