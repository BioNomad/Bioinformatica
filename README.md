# Bioinforpedia

Welcome to the working repository for Bioinforpedia! Here I will apply various bioinformatics analysis techniques to TCGA-LLG data in an effort to both cement my understanding of these topics but also provide a resource for others learning bioinformatics. Topics will include: regression, ANOVA, model building, PCA, clustering, machine learning, network analysis, etc.
